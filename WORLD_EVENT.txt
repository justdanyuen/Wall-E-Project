Include a text file named WORLD_EVENT.txt in your submission that describes:
1. how to trigger the event
    Each of our scenes has an objective.
    Scene 1: Pick up all the trash which triggers a boot with a plant in it to appear.
             After picking up the boot, Eve (another robot) appears.
             Reaching her is the final objective.
             This will cause a scene change.
    Scene 2: This scene's objective is to navigate through the robot obstacles in order to save Eve
            on the spaceship. After reaching Eve, scene 3 is displayed.
    Scene 3: This scene's objective is to navigate through the maze to plant the boot, similar to the movie.
              Scene 4, which is like an end credit scene is triggered after planting the boot.

2. what should happen when the event is triggered
